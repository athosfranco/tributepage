			<h2>Profile</h2>

			<p>Diébédo Francis Kéré (Born April 10, 1965, in Gando, Burkina Faso) is an African architect known for his projects with sustainability, low-cost material and labor from the local community. Keré always seeks to develop a strong partnership with the communities for which he builds, always showing a special sensitivity to the place and to the social, economic and climatic conditions.</p><br>
			<p>He was the first in his village to be sent to school, as his father, the village chief, wanted his eldest son to learn to read and translate his letters. Since there was no school in Gando, Diébédo Kéré had to leave his family when he was just seven years old to live with his uncle in the city. After finishing his studies, he became a carpenter and received a scholarship from the Carl Duisberg Society to do an internship in Germany as a development aid supervisor. Later he studied at the Technical University of Berlin (Tu Berlin), graduating in 2004.</p><br>
			<p>Upon completing his studies, Kéré conceived the project for the first Primary School in Gando, the small village where he was born, in the south of his country. Using local raw materials and sustainable architecture, this project won the Aga Khan Architecture Award in 2004. It has projects in Mali, Kenya, Uganda, Germany, Yemen, China and the United States.</p>

			<h3>Mission</h3>
			<p>Known for his social engagement, Francis Kéré is an architect who is dedicated to creating proposals that improve the living conditions of people in poor communities in Africa. Keré believes that education can change lives - because his has been changed - and he felt it was his duty to contribute to his family and his community, giving the next generation the opportunity to follow in his footsteps. In 1998, with the help of his friends, Kéré created the Schulbausteine ​​für Gando eV association (now Kéré eV Foundation), which can be freely translated as "Building Blocks for Gando", to finance the construction of a primary school for your village.</p>
			<p>His aim was to combine the knowledge he acquired in Europe with the traditional construction methods of Burkina Faso. He completed his studies and built the first school in Gando as a diploma project in 2004, while opening his own architecture firm Kéré Architecture. Although his office is located in Berlin, many of his projects are developed in his native country, Burkina Faso, in West Africa, where he is known for incorporating vernacular materials and local labor into his projects, being a great reference in practices and techniques of Bioarchitecture.</p><br>

				<h5>Gando Primary School (2001)</h5><br>
				<p>Kéré was the first son of the head of the village, who allowed him to attend school as a child – although this was very rare. By building Gando Primary School, Kéré made it possible for any child in the village to receive an education. It was his first ever architecture project, and set a precedent for a style of architecture that combines traditional building techniques with modern engineering methods. "I did a modern building that is not westernised, and not a traditional African building," he explains. He says his aim was "to create a building that responded the best to the need of the climate and the need of the people, using the most available material".The primary school was built out of mud bricks, something the community was initially somewhat skeptical about. They were concerned that a mud brick construction would not survive the rain season. But Kéré's innovative design provided the solution. A wide, raised tin roof protects the walls from the rain, and allows air to circulate underneath in order to keep the building cool. The community was delighted to find the school still standing after ten years, and the building is much cooler and more pleasant to work in than the conventional concrete school buildings. Kéré's design has become renowned throughout Burkina Faso, and won the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2004.<br>[Hover to hide]</p>

				<h5>Centre for Earth Architecture (2010)</h5><br>
				<p>The Aga Khan Trust for Culture has spent over 10 years renovating mosques in Northern Mali. Finished in 2010, the Centre for Earth Architecture in Mopti is part of this series of projects, following the restoration of the mosque and the construction of a new sewerage system. The Centre is intended to be much more than an exhibition space: the building is the product of the same ancient building techniques used in the Great Mosques in Mopti, Timbuktu and Djenné. It demonstrates how a material that is a part of the area's heritage can be used in a modern context. The Centre is made up of an exhibition hall, a community centre, public toilets and a restaurant, responding to the needs of the district management of Komoguel and visitors to the area, as well as the local community.<br>[Hover to hide]</p>

				<h5>Sepertine Pavillion (2017)</h5><br>
				<p>First installed in London, and then moved to Malaysia, the pavilion was created as a micro cosmos - "a community structure within Kensington Gardens" - designed to consciously merge as cultural references in Kéré's hometown (Gando, Burkino Faso ), with "experimental construction techniques". The architect hopes that the pavilion, as a social condenser, "will become a beacon of light, a symbol for narratives and unity". The pavilion has a large suspended roof made of steel and a transparent skin covering the structure, which allows sunlight to penetrate the space, protecting it from rain. The shading elements of the wood align a lower part of the roof to create a dynamic shade effect in the interior spaces. This combination of features a sense of freedom and community; like the shade of tree branches, the Pavilion becomes a place where people can get together and share their experiences.<br>[Hover to hide]</p>
